# Mortgage PDF Bot - Chat with your Mortgage Docs! 

## Intro 

This application seeks to improve productivity of mortgage brokers by allowing them to chat with various documents including: 

- Lender Guidelines
- Lender Processes
- Mortgage Insurance Guidelines
- Mortgage Insurance Programs
..etc 

The current version allows the upload of multiple PDFs. Before chatting, users must select the PDFs from their local machine, and then can ask any question related to the contents of the document.

Next steps: 
- Connect to a database to centrally manage which PDFS are used as input to the model. Many of the above listed documents are only updated once every year, and therefore having to re-upload them each time a user wants to chat with the PDFs is inconvenient.
- Pull information about lender rates, which are sent through e-mail on a daily basis, into the above mentioned database, allowing brokers to very easily determine which lender has the best rate for their client's case.
